# Cubic World

A world handling library for Minecraft Java Edition written in C++

## Status

This project has not been started yet, but will be started soon:tm:

## Goals

The goal is to have a complete world handling library to read, modify, and
convert Minecraft Java Edition worlds.

## Running

Precompiled binaries are not currently available.

See **Building** section to know how to compile the library.

## Building

Currently **only Linux x86_64** is targeted, it might build on another system
but it isn't guaranted for now (Windows, FreeBSD and OpenBSD will be supported
later down the road, but not until we have a solid codebase.)

### Dependencies

Here is the list of dependencies required to build CubicWorld:

 - gcc7\* (Any c++17 compliant compiler should work but it is not guarranted as
 we do not code strictly to the standard)
 - gnumake (Build system, other make versions might work but have not been
 tested)

\* gcc7 is the lowest version that should work with this codebase but it has
not been tested yet, a higher compiler version will always be recommended for
optimization reasons. See the gcc c++17 feature matrix
[here](https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx17).

### How to build
#### Build from source on your machine
To build follow those steps :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CubicMC/cubic-world
cd cubic-world
# Currently doesn't work as the project hasn't been started yet
make -j `nproc --exclude 1` # The -j option is here to speed-up the compilation
```

## TODO for this README

- Testing
- Lib deps
- Build system explaination

## Contributing
